This project is a high-performance, all-in-one environmental monitor. It pairs the Arduino Nicla Sense Env with the LilyGo T-Display S3 AMOLED screen.
It's designed to read all 9 key sensor values from the Nicla (like temperature, humidity, IAQ, eCO2, TVOC, O3, and NO2) and display them on a sleek, responsive, and easy-to-read dark mode dashboard.
I had two main goals:
To build a dashboard that felt like a professional product, not a laggy prototype. Most DIY sensor projects suffer from screen flicker and lag, especially when updating many data points. I wanted to solve this and create a UI that was perfectly smooth.
The Nicla Sense env is an "all-in-one" environmental sensor that can show all its data (both Indoor and Outdoor AQI) at a glance.
The project works by combining hardware connections with high-efficiency display code.
Hardware: The T-Display S3 acts as the I2C master and connects directly to the Nicla Sense Env's ESLOV port (or via a STEMMA QT connector) using just four wires: SDA, SCL, 3V3, and GND. The T-Display powers the Nicla and requests data from it.
Software :The key to the smooth, flicker-free performance is the display logic.
Non-Blocking Code: The entire project uses a millis() timer instead of delay(). The main loop is always running, checking for new data and user input (like the calibration button) without ever freezing.
Differential Rendering: The code stores the "previous" value for every single sensor. In each loop, it compares the new sensor data to the previous data.
Targeted Updates: If a value hasn't changed, the code does nothing. If it has changed (e.g., temperature goes from 25.1°C to 25.2°C), it erases and redraws only the small rectangle containing that specific number, not the entire screen.
This technique, combined with an off-screen graphics canvas (Arduino_Canvas), is what completely eliminates flicker and makes the display look instantaneous and professional.
