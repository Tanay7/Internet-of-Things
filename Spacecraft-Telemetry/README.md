# Voyager 1 Telemetry Simulation on T-Beam SUPREME LoRa Board

## Author: Tanay

## Introduction

This project simulates a basic spacecraft telemetry system, demonstrating the fundamental principles of data acquisition, packetization, error correction, and wireless communication. It consists of two main components: a **transmitter** that simulates a spacecraft gathering sensor data and sending it to Earth, and a **receiver** that simulates a ground station receiving and processing this data. The system utilizes LoRa radio for communication, structures data into CCSDS (Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems) compliant packets, and employs Reed-Solomon Forward Error Correction (RS-FEC) for robust data transmission. **This project was built and tested using the LilyGO T-Beam S3 Supreme L76K.**

## Voyager 1 Context

The design of this telemetry system draws inspiration from real-world spacecraft missions, most notably the Voyager 1 mission. Launched in 1977, Voyager 1 is one of humanity's most iconic deep space probes, currently exploring interstellar space billions of miles from Earth. Its communication system provides a compelling example of the challenges and solutions involved in transmitting data over vast distances.

* **Deep Space Network (DSN):** Voyager 1 communicates with Earth using NASA's Deep Space Network, a network of large parabolic radio antennas located around the world. These antennas are highly sensitive to the faint signals received from deep space probes. Our simulation uses LoRa, a lower-power, shorter-range radio technology, but the concept of a dedicated network for receiving spacecraft data is analogous.
* **Data Rates and Distances:** Due to the immense distance, the data rate from Voyager 1 is extremely low, measured in bits per second (bps). As of 2020, the downlink rate was around 160 bps. While our LoRa simulation has a much higher potential data rate, the principle of balancing data rate with range and signal strength remains relevant.
* **Importance of Error Correction:** Over such vast distances, signals are significantly attenuated and corrupted by noise. Therefore, robust error correction codes are crucial for ensuring the integrity of the received scientific data. Voyager 1 has used various coding schemes throughout its mission, including convolutional codes and Reed-Solomon codes (though perhaps not exactly RS(255, 223) in all phases). Our use of RS-FEC mirrors this critical aspect of deep space communication.
* **CCSDS Standards:** Missions like Voyager 1 adhere to CCSDS standards for telemetry and telecommand to ensure interoperability and standardized data handling across different space agencies and missions. Our simulation's adoption of CCSDS packet structures reflects this industry-wide practice.
* **Sensor Data:** Voyager 1 carries a suite of sophisticated scientific instruments to study planetary environments, magnetic fields, and cosmic rays. The types of sensor data simulated in our project (environmental, magnetic, inertial, GPS, power management) are representative of the kinds of information collected by spacecraft, albeit in a simplified form.

## Communication Protocol

### CCSDS Packet Structure

Both the transmitter and receiver are designed to work with CCSDS Application Packets (APs). The structure of these packets is defined by the `CCSDSPacket` struct in both codes and includes:

* **Primary Header:** Contains version, type, APID, sequence flags, sequence count, and packet length.
* **Data Field:** Contains the sensor readings in a specific order (temperature, pressure, humidity, altitude, magnetic field, inertial data, GPS data, PMU data, and a message string).
* **Packet Error Control:** A 16-bit CRC (CCITT-FALSE) is appended to the data field.

### Reed-Solomon FEC

Both the transmitter and receiver implement an RS(255, 223) Reed-Solomon code. The transmitter encodes the 223 bytes of CCSDS packet data with 32 bytes of parity information, resulting in a 255-byte block for transmission. The receiver uses these 32 parity bytes to correct up to 16 byte errors that may have occurred during transmission.

### LoRa Configuration

For successful communication, the LoRa radio parameters on both the transmitter and receiver **must be identical**. This includes the carrier frequency, bandwidth, spreading factor, coding rate, and sync word. Any mismatch in these parameters will prevent the receiver from correctly demodulating the signals from the transmitter.

## Error Handling

Both the transmitter and receiver include basic error handling mechanisms. The transmitter checks for successful sensor initialization, and both systems have a fatal error display routine for critical failures. The receiver also tracks CRC errors, Reed-Solomon decoding errors, and data range errors to provide insights into the quality of the communication link and the received data.
